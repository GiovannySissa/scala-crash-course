# Scala getting started

## Why Scala?

Scala could be used following object-oriented style or functional style, it's a static typed language which means you could
avoid issues in runtime, it's build upon Java Virtual Machine (almost in their version 2)


- Compiled language
- Easy safety and correctness
- Deep ecosystem


This repo contains a basic introduction to Scala programming language, the topics covered will be focused
Functional programming. You don't need any previous experience using that programming paradigm due we are going to show
the basics to more advanced topics. Hope you enjoy!


## Install scala 

To enhance your experience I highly recommend you install Scala in order you are be able to
try the exercises by yourself. 

you have two options to install Scala:

1. Using coursier, it will give you other tools to using scala (not covered)
2. Manually, just install Java Virtual Machine(JVM) and sbt.

wherever be your choose follow this [instructions](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html)
also, you can use an interactive scala console online using [scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/)

if you use Intellij add the [Scala plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala) otherwise take a look [metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs) project
probably your favorite editor is supported.
